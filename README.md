# Goparity Full Stack Coding Challenge

## Description 📘

The challenge consists of two parts: a back-end laravel project where you are expected to develop the logic of handling payment processing and a front-end Vue.js project where where you should create a CMS type application where you can see the amortizations and perform some actions like trigger their payment. The two parts should communicate via an API.

## How to start? 🤔

1. Familiarize yourself with the source code
2. Start with the backend-challenge. The guidelines are at the README.md file.
3. Move on to the frontend challenge. The guidelines are at the README.md file.

## Usage 🧑‍💻

You can run each part of the challenge separatly by installing the required technologies. And runing the following command for the back-end:

```
php artisan serve
```

And for the front-end:

```
npm run dev
```

But if you want you can also use Docker and the provided docker-compose.yml file to run both projects with the command:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

## Evaluation Criteria 🧪

1. Correctness and accuracy of the Laravel payment processing implementation.
2. Efficiency and scalability of the Laravel function when handling large datasets.
3. Code structure, organization, and adherence to Laravel and Vue.js best practices.
4. Clarity and readability of the code.
5. User interface design and functionality of the Vue.js amortization list.
6. Comment quality and any additional instructions.

## Notes 📝

- We are interested in seeing your problem-solving approach and coding style, so please avoid using external libraries other than Vue, TypeScript and TailwindCSS for this particular challenge (extra credit in the frontend-challenge is excluded - show your creativity)
- Remember to comment your code to explain your thought process, implementation choices, and any complex logic.
